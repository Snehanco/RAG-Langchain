Jobs was also the founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.\\nJobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. \\nJobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the largely unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh launched the desktop publishing industry in 1985 (for example, the Aldus Pagemaker) with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics and PostScript.\\nIn 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company\\'s board and its then-CEO, John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took some Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets, serving as its CEO. In 1986, he bought the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm, which was spun off independently as Pixar. Pixar produced the first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story (1995), and became a leading animation studio, producing dozens of commercially successful and critically acclaimed films.\\nIn 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company\\'s acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the \"Think different\" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad.

      "\n",
      "Steve Jobs’ departure from Apple in 1985 is one of the most dramatic moments in corporate history. While it is often simplified to “Jobs was fired,” the reality was a complex power struggle that involved personality clashes, divergent visions for the company, and a series of business missteps. Below is a step‑by‑step breakdown of the factors that led to Jobs’ exit, the key players involved, and the aftermath that shaped Apple’s future.\n",

      "| 1978 | Jobs recruits John Sculley, a seasoned executive from PepsiCo, to serve as CEO. |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why it mattered:** Jobs’ entrepreneurial spirit and Wozniak’s engineering brilliance created a product‑centric culture. When Sculley joined, Apple gained a corporate‑savvy leader, but also a new internal dynamic that would later become a source of friction.\n",

      "1. **Macintosh’s High Price Tag** – At $2,500 in 1984, it was a steep price for a personal computer. Jobs insisted on a “no compromise” approach to design, which limited the product’s market reach.\n",
      "2. **Sales Lag** – While the Apple II continued to sell well, the Macintosh struggled to gain traction, leading to concerns about profitability.\n",

      "Steve Jobs was not “fired” in the traditional sense; he was forced out by a combination of board pressure, a clash of leadership styles, and the commercial underperformance of the Macintosh. The decision was made by Apple’s board, led by John Sculley, who feared that Jobs’ uncompromising approach could jeopardize the company’s financial stability. Jobs’ exit paved the way for his later ventures, including NeXT and Pixar, and ultimately set the stage for his triumphant return to Apple, where he would reshape the company into the technology titan it is today.\n"

Filming began in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive on the project, with editor Elliot Graham starting while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as composer, with a focus on dividing the score into three distinguishable sections.\\nSteve Jobs premiered at the 2015 Telluride Film Festival on September 5, 2015, and began a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on October 9, 2015. It opened nationwide in the United States on October 23, 2015, to positive reviews and grossed $34.4 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million. People close to Jobs such as Steve Wozniak and John Sculley praised the performances, but the film also received criticism for historical inaccuracy. Steve Jobs was nominated for Best Actor (Fassbender) and Best Supporting Actress (Winslet) at the 88th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades.\\n\\n\", 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(film)'}, page_content='conducted by Sorkin.
