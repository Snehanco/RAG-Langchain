Machine Learning Fundamentals

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. It involves various algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. The key types of machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors. Applications of machine learning span across various industries, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and more. Common algorithms used in machine learning include decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering techniques. As the field continues to evolve, advancements in deep learning and neural networks are driving significant progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.
