Natural Language Processing (NLP)

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of algorithms and models that enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is meaningful. NLP encompasses various tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, and speech recognition. Techniques used in NLP include tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and semantic analysis. Recent advancements in NLP have been driven by deep learning models such as transformers, which have significantly improved the performance of language models like BERT and GPT. Applications of NLP are widespread, including chatbots, virtual assistants, automated customer support, and content recommendation systems. As NLP continues to advance, it plays a crucial role in enhancing human-computer interaction and enabling more natural communication with technology.
