       "AIMessage(content=' Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to achieve a goal. The agent interacts with the environment by performing actions and receives rewards or punishments (referred to as \"reinforcements\") based on the outcomes of these actions.\\n\\nThe main objective of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn a policy, which is a strategy that maps states of the environment to actions that maximize the cumulative reward over time. The agent\\'s goal is to learn the optimal policy that will help it make the best decisions possible in the given environment.\\n\\nHere are some key components of reinforcement learning:\\n\\n1. Agent: An entity that interacts with an environment and makes decisions based on its observations and learned policies.\\n2. Environment: The environment is where the agent performs actions, and changes its state as a result of these actions. The environment also provides rewards or penalties to the agent for taking certain actions.\\n3. State: A representation of the current situation in the environment, which may include information about the agent\\'s position, objects around it, or any other relevant factors.\\n4. Action: An action is a move or decision that the agent takes in response to its current state. The set of possible actions can vary depending on the environment and the agent.\\n5. Reward: A numerical value assigned to an outcome to indicate whether the agent\\'s action was good, bad, or neutral. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.\\n6. Policy: A strategy that maps states to actions, guiding the agent in its decision-making process. The policy is learned through trial and error based on the rewards received from taking different actions in various states.\\n7. Q-value (Quality value): In Q-learning, a Q-table is used to store the estimated reward values for each state-action pair. The goal of the agent is to learn the optimal Q-values that lead to the highest cumulative rewards.\\n8. Exploration vs Exploitation: An essential trade-off in reinforcement learning is between exploration (trying out new actions to discover better strategies) and exploitation (using the current knowledge to select actions with high estimated reward values). The agent must balance these two aspects to optimally learn its policy.\\n\\nReinforcement learning has a wide range of applications, including game playing, robotics, autonomous driving, and recommendation systems. It is a powerful tool for training intelligent agents that can make decisions in complex and dynamic environments.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'mistral:latest', 'created_at': '2025-10-27T13:21:29.6782782Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 11234521800, 'load_duration': 19612400, 'prompt_eval_count': 13, 'prompt_eval_duration': 50225000, 'eval_count': 549, 'eval_duration': 10923075800, 'model_name': 'mistral:latest', 'model_provider': 'ollama'}, id='lc_run--4e2ea830-ff0a-4623-8a98-97870293b775-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 549, 'total_tokens': 562})"
