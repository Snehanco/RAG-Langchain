       "AIMessage(content=\" Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning that involves training an agent to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The goal is for the agent to learn a policy, which is a strategy or rule set that maps states of the environment to actions that maximize some notion of cumulative reward.\\n\\nHere's a simplified breakdown of the concept:\\n\\n1. **Agent**: In reinforcement learning, an agent interacts with its environment by performing actions and receiving rewards or punishments. The agent's goal is to learn how to take actions that maximize some notion of cumulative reward (or minimize negative reward).\\n\\n2. **State**: Each state represents a situation in the environment that the agent finds itself in. For example, consider an autonomous car driving on a highway. Each state could represent a specific configuration of the car's sensors data (e.g., speed, distance to other cars, traffic signs, etc.).\\n\\n3. **Action**: The agent chooses an action at each time step based on its current state and previous learning. The agent's goal is to learn which actions lead to desirable states with high rewards.\\n\\n4. **Reward**: The environment provides the agent with a reward signal after each action, indicating whether the chosen action was good or bad. Rewards can be positive (e.g., +1 point) or negative (e.g., -1 point). In some cases, there may also be no immediate reward, but the goal is to maximize the total cumulative reward over time.\\n\\n5. **Policy**: A policy represents a strategy that the agent uses to decide which action to take in each state. The policy can be deterministic (always choosing the same action for a given state) or stochastic (choosing actions based on probabilities).\\n\\n6. **Value Function**: The value function estimates the expected cumulative reward an agent will receive when starting from a specific state and following its current policy. It helps the agent decide whether it should take a certain action in a particular state by evaluating the potential rewards and risks.\\n\\n7. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: During learning, the agent faces a trade-off between exploring new states (actions) to gather more information and exploiting its current knowledge to achieve higher immediate rewards. Finding an optimal balance is crucial for efficient reinforcement learning.\\n\\n8. **Training**: The agent learns by iteratively interacting with its environment, trying different actions, receiving rewards, updating its policy based on the obtained knowledge, and repeating the process until it achieves a desired level of performance or convergence to an optimal policy.\\n\\nReinforcement learning has applications in various fields such as game playing (e.g., AlphaGo), robotics (e.g., grasping objects), navigation (e.g., self-driving cars), and even finance (e.g., trading strategies).\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'mistral:latest', 'created_at': '2025-10-26T10:36:53.9587587Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 17451470200, 'load_duration': 3844474500, 'prompt_eval_count': 13, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1224320600, 'eval_count': 619, 'eval_duration': 12103516200, 'model_name': 'mistral:latest', 'model_provider': 'ollama'}, id='lc_run--6b887db8-5ed3-4c57-b3c6-f0a75c7f31ea-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 619, 'total_tokens': 632})"
