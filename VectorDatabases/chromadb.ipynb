       "AIMessage(content=\" Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with its environment. The goal is for the agent to learn a policy, which is a strategy that maps states to actions, enabling it to maximize some notion of cumulative reward over time.\\n\\nHere's a simplified breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Agent**: This is the learning entity that interacts with the environment. It can be anything from a robot arm in a factory, an autonomous car, or even an AI playing a video game.\\n\\n2. **Environment**: This is the world in which the agent operates. The environment could be a physical space (like a room), a virtual space (like a video game), or even an abstract concept (like financial markets).\\n\\n3. **State**: At any given time, the environment is in some specific condition or configuration. This state is observed by the agent and used to decide its next action.\\n\\n4. **Action**: The agent selects an action based on its current state. Actions change the environment, moving it from one state to another.\\n\\n5. **Reward**: After each action, the environment provides a reward signal to the agent. This signal helps the agent to understand whether its actions are leading it closer or further away from its goal. The goal is for the agent to learn which actions lead to the highest rewards over time.\\n\\n6. **Policy**: A policy is a strategy that the agent uses to decide which action to take in each state, based on its current understanding of the environment. The policy can be deterministic (always selecting the same action for the same state) or stochastic (selecting actions probabilistically).\\n\\n7. **Value Function**: In reinforcement learning, a value function assigns a value to each state or state-action pair, representing how good it is to be in that state and take that action, given the current policy. The goal of reinforcement learning is to learn an optimal policy, for which the value functions represent the expected cumulative reward over time.\\n\\nThrough trial and error, the agent iteratively updates its policy to improve its performance, aiming to maximize its total reward. This is often achieved through techniques like Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or policy gradients, among others. The goal is for the agent to learn a policy that generalizes well to new states and situations, making it capable of intelligent decision-making in complex, dynamic environments.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'mistral:latest', 'created_at': '2025-10-29T10:16:35.6436242Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 10875488200, 'load_duration': 22233900, 'prompt_eval_count': 13, 'prompt_eval_duration': 46796300, 'eval_count': 530, 'eval_duration': 10580894300, 'model_name': 'mistral:latest', 'model_provider': 'ollama'}, id='lc_run--ec8e4262-ed20-4792-84e2-e2593b417688-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 13, 'output_tokens': 530, 'total_tokens': 543})"

      "Answer:  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of deep learning model that specializes in processing grid-structured data, such as images. They automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from input data using convolutional layers. Widely used in computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation due to their ability to capture local patterns and reduce dimensionality.\n",
